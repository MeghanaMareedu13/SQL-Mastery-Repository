> **Day 3 of 30-Day Challenge** | A collection of high-impact SQL queries ranging from core concepts to advanced data analysis techniques.

## 🚀 Overview

This repository showcases my SQL expertise through a practical "Sales & Employee Performance" scenario. It includes complex joins, window functions, recursive CTEs, and performance-oriented query structures.

## 📂 Repository Structure

| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `schema.sql` | Table definitions and relationships (PostgreSQL compatible) |
| `data.sql` | Realistic sample dataset for testing |
| `queries.sql` | The core "Mastery" queries with explanations |

## 💡 What's Inside?

### 1. Window Functions (`RANK`, `ROW_NUMBER`)
Used to rank employees by salary within their respective departments without collapsing rows.

### 2. Common Table Expressions (CTE)
Implemented for cleaner, more readable logic when calculating department-level metrics.

### 3. Recursive CTE (Hierarchy)
A classic enterprise use case: mapping out an organizational reporting structure from top to bottom.

### 4. Running Totals & Moving Averages
Demonstrating analytical depth by calculating 3-day moving averages and cumulative sales totals.

## 🛠️ How to Use

1. **Setup**: Run `schema.sql` in your SQL editor (PostgreSQL, MySQL, or SQLite).
2. **Populate**: Run `data.sql` to insert the sample records.
3. **Analyze**: Explore `queries.sql` to see intermediate to expert-level data retrieval.

## 📈 Real-World Applications

These queries are modeled after real scenarios I encountered as an **Analyst**, where data extraction speed and accuracy are critical for business strategy.
