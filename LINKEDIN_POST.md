📊 **Day 3 of 30: 5 SQL Queries Every Data Professional Should Know**

SQL is the backbone of data engineering and analysis. At Virtusa, I used these patterns daily to transform billions of rows into clear business insights. 

Today, I’m sharing my **SQL Mastery Repository** – a deep dive into the queries that move the needle in enterprise environments.

💡 **Today’s Technical Deep-Dive:**

1️⃣ **Window Functions (RANK/LEAD/LAG)**
   Forget simple GROUP BY. RANK() allows you to find Top N performers per region without losing row-level detail.

2️⃣ **Common Table Expressions (CTEs)**
   Clean code is maintainable code. CTEs make your complex subqueries readable and easy to debug.

3️⃣ **Recursive CTEs**
   Essential for "Organizational Hierarchies" or "Bill of Materials." A must-know for anyone working with parent-child data.

4️⃣ **Self-Joins**
   Perfect for comparing rows to themselves (e.g., comparing this month's sale to last month's for the same employee).

5️⃣ **Moving Averages & Running Totals**
   The key to smoothing out data volatility and seeing true business trends over time.

**Real Impact:**
In my previous projects, optimizing these SQL patterns helped reduce system downtime by **40%** and provided actionable insights to Agile teams in record time.
